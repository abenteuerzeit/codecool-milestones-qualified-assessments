# Codecool Milestones and Qualified Assessments

I am sharing the tests from Codecool's Qualified Assessment Milestones for the C# .NET full stack developper course. 
Please note: 
- Most of these tests are correct and all pass. However, some tests or answers are incorrect. 

If you find any errors, 
- Please fork this and then create a pull request to merge the changes into this master branch. 
- Feel free to add any new assessments, including task requirements and relevant inforamtion, and if possible any tests that can be run against the implementations, with your solutions. 
- Even if your solution is incomplete, we could bridge the knowledge gap by asking others to help improve the implementation(s).
- Feel free to refactor the code.
